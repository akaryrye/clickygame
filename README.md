# Clicky Game

#### How To Use:
When the app loads, you will see pictures of nine male actors.  When one is clicked, the pictures are shuffled, and the counter will increase by one.  Try to click all of the actors without hitting the same one twice.  If you click any twice, the game is over and will reset.
